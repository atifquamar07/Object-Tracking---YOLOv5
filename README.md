# Object-Tracking---YOLOv5
An Multi-Object Tracking with Detection, implementation of predicting the positions of objects throughout a video using their spatial as well as temporal features. Tracking has been performed using a pretrained YOLOv5 object detection model and the Simple
Online Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm.
