# Object-Tracking---YOLOv5
A Multi-Object Tracking with Detection, implementation of predicting the positions of objects throughout a video using their spatial as well as temporal features. Tracking has been performed using a pretrained YOLOv5 object detection model and the Simple
Online Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm.

## Raw Video generated using "KITTI_17_images" dataset
